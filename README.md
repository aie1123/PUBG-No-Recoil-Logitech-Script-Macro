  ## Considering that some people have reported bans, it is recommended to use a new method to load macros:  
* ① Download and place the macro file in a location other than the C drive  
* ② Create a new script in GHUB  
* ③ Edit the script code to:  
Example:` data = dofile[[D:\yourmacrolocation.lua]]`
* ④ Save and run
